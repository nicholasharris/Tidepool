# Tidepool
Evolution based browser game implemented in javascript for a class project. Includes a UI and a simulated environment where evolvable creatures compete to survive and reproduce. Some of the UI elements are not fully fleshed out, but you can alter a few paramters and watch a population evolve under the selected conditions.
